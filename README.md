Web design homework

I created seven html files for viewing and one html file (table.html) file for importing the cities.csv data. I also created a jupyter file (table.ipynb) in order to read the csv data into a pandas dataframe and write it to the html file noted above.

This was a cool and challenging homework for me. The only thing I was unable to resolve was moving the Plots, Comparison, and Data items in my navigation bar to be aligned on the right side of the nav bar.
